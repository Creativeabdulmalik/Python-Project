# Python Project

This repository showcases a Python programming capstone project as part of my data science journey with Arewa Data Science Academy.

# Project Overview

In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the taxi_organization dataset using Jupyter Notebook within Visual Studio Code.

The project began with downloading the dataset from the Data Science Nigeria Bootcamp Competition (2024). The data preprocessing stage involved:

Handling duplicates and addressing missing values.

Transforming categorical variables into quantifiable formats to ensure usability.

## For visualization, I utilized various plots, including:

Bar charts

Histograms

Scatter plots

Box plots

These visualizations provided insights into the relationships between variables and helped identify trends and patterns within the taxi_organization dataset.

## Problem Statement of the Analysis

Identify trends and patterns between variables.

Visualize the relationship between payment types and total revenue generated.

Analyze the relationship between fare amount and trip distance.
